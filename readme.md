# Collaborative Coding Extension for GeeksForGeeks

## Overview

This collaborative coding extension for GeeksForGeeks enhances the coding experience by incorporating real-time collaboration features using WebRTC technology. It enables users to share their screens, exchange messages, and collaborate effectively during coding sessions. The extension is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the WebRTC API, Agora Signaling SDK, and STUN servers.

## Features

- **Screen Sharing**: Users can share their screens with peers in real-time, allowing them to view and edit code together.
- **Messaging**: The extension facilitates instant messaging between users, enabling seamless communication during coding sessions.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: With WebRTC, users can collaborate on coding projects simultaneously, enhancing productivity and teamwork.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The extension provides a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and intuitive usage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the extension's user interface.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language for designing and styling the extension's appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for implementing interactive functionality and communication.
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: A free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication capabilities via simple APIs.
- **Agora Signaling SDK**: A cloud-based signaling service provided by Agora.io, used for real-time messaging and signaling.
- **STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) Servers**: Servers used to help establish peer-to-peer connections between devices behind NAT (Network Address Translation) firewalls.

## WebRTC Concept

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a powerful API that enables real-time communication between web browsers and mobile applications. It allows direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need for intermediary servers in most cases. WebRTC facilitates audio and video communication, as well as data sharing, making it ideal for applications such as video conferencing, online gaming, and collaborative coding.

### Key Components of WebRTC:

- **MediaStream API**: Enables access to the user's audio and video input devices, allowing for audio and video streaming.
- **RTCPeerConnection**: Facilitates peer-to-peer communication, handling the establishment, maintenance, and closing of connections.
- **RTCDataChannel**: Enables bidirectional communication of arbitrary data between peers.
- **Signaling**: The process of coordinating communication between peers, including exchanging session control messages and signaling information necessary to establish connections.

## Getting Started
